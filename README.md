# SmartPrix Laptop Dataset Cleaning and Analysis with PostgreSQL

## üìö Project Overview

This project involves cleaning, transforming and analyzing the SmartPrix Laptop Dataset to uncover key insights related to pricing, performance, market trends, and user experiences using PostgreSQL. The dataset was scraped directly from the SmartPrix website in India in March 2024 and contains 1020 rows and 27 columns, detailing various features of laptops available in the Indian market.

Using PostgreSQL, the dataset was cleaned to remove duplicates, standardize data formats, and ensure consistency for meaningful analysis. SQL was utilized for both the data cleaning and analysis processes, with each step documented in separate SQL files for better organization and clarity. Additionally, two Jupyter notebooks provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the analysis, with SQL queries connected directly to a PostgreSQL database for interactive exploration of results.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database management system used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **SQL**: For writing queries to clean and manipulate the data.
- **pgAdmin**: To manage and query the PostgreSQL database.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting SQL queries and running analyses.


## üìä Dataset Description

The SmartPrix Laptop Unclean Dataset includes 1020 rows and 27 columns. The columns represent various features of laptops, such as:

- `name`: Name of the model
- `price`: Price of the laptop
- `spec_score`: Spec score based on features
- `votes`: Number of votes by buyers
- `user_rating`: Ratings by buyers
- `os`: Operating system
- `utility`: Intended use of the laptop
- `thickness`: Thickness of the laptop
- `weight`: Weight of the laptop
- `warranty`: Warranty period
- `screen_size`: Screen size
- `resolution`: Screen resolution
- `ppi`: Pixels per inch
- `battery`: Battery capacity in Watt-hours
- `processor_name`: Name of the processor
- `processor_speed`: Processor speed and configuration
- `no_cores`: Number of processor cores
- `caches`: Cache memory
- `graphics_card`: Graphics card information
- `rom_memory`: ROM memory type
- `internal_memory`: RAM capacity
- `port_connection`: Available ports
- `wireless_connection`: Wireless connectivity features
- `usb_ports`: Types of USB ports available
- `hardware_features`: Additional hardware features

The dataset is raw and unclean, requiring extensive data cleaning to address both structural and qualitative issues before it can be used for any meaningful analysis or predictions.

The data cleaning process involves:

1. **Handling Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate rows based on key columns like laptop names, specifications, and prices.

2. **Handling Structural Issues**: Removing or correcting any structural anomalies in the dataset, such as missing columns, incorrect data types, and misaligned data.

3. **Cleaning Text Data**: Standardizing text data to remove inconsistencies like extra spaces, invisible characters, and inconsistent casing.

4. **Extracting and Transforming Data**: Using SQL‚Äôs `REGEXP_REPLACE`, `SUBSTRING`, and other string functions to extract meaningful components from complex strings (e.g., extracting processor models, handling multiple core configurations).

5. **Normalizing Values**: Ensuring that numerical data is consistently formatted and converting string representations of numbers to numeric types where necessary.

6. **Validation**: Checking for and correcting any remaining anomalies to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
